# Expectation-Maximization and MINIT 


## Introduction
This is an assignment project in STA243 from UC Davis Statistic Department. The purpose of this repository is to enhance the understanding of EM algorithm introduced in class by implementing it to classify real world digits using R. Any errors are mine.

## Work in Progress

There are lots of places to improve. Currently, I am running only for 10 iterations. I need to find a way to speed up the code. Just like anything else in life, implementing this algorithem is much more difficult than just nodding head during the lecture. It took me already 25 hours straight to write this current version.
