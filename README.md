# Expectation-Maximization and MNIST 


## Introduction
This is an assignment project in STA243 from UC Davis Statistic Department. The purpose of this repository is to enhance the understanding of EM algorithm introduced in class by implementing it to classify real world digits using R. Any errors are mine.

## Work in Progress

There are lots of places to improve. Currently, I am running only for 100 iterations. I need to find a way to speed up the code. Just like anything else in life, implementing this algorithem is much more difficult than just nodding my head during the lecture. 

To be continued.
